# Buffer_2.0
Buffer_2.0 repo to submit your projects to.Repository containing folder-wise code for all submissions to Buffer : A Project Series, conducted between April, 2021 - June, 2020.

Each folder should contain a separate README to describe the files and project objective

1) Objective of the project.
 This system concerns about the working of a shopping
mall from owner’s point of view. We’ve worked on 
functions like create, display, update, search, generating 
bill. There are different departments and we can add items 
accordingly.
2) Data structure used.
 Binary tree- As we want our code to be more optimized
we are using binary tree as its complexity is less (log(n)). 
Tree is used to store item id, name, price and quantity.
3) Learnings from this project.
 We learnt to apply data structures in real world 
problems. By using this code we can optimize owner’s 
time by directly searching, updating, adding items and also 
creating bills.
4) What’s next for the project?
 We can also expand the code for costumers to shop 
online also. We can also create a website for shopping 
online.
