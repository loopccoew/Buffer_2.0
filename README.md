# Buffer_2.0
Buffer_2.0 repo to submit your projects to.Repository containing folder-wise code for all submissions to Buffer : A Project Series, conducted between April, 2021 - June, 2020.

Each folder should contain a separate README to describe the files and project objective..

Objective of the Project- Create a text editor which implements all the functions of a basic Notepad using Data Structures.

Data Structures used- 
Array of objects: Used in find and replace function for highlighting the text. Useful when all of the objects should be constructed in a uniform way or when the "real" constructor information will not be know until sometime during the computation. In the later case, the array can be declared and the individual objects manipulated when the information is discovered.

String data type implemented as array: String datatype is used throughout the project as an array of objects. This is because each element is a String and you know that in Java, String is an object. You can do all the operations on String array like sorting, adding an element, joining, splitting, searching, etc.

Stack for undermanager:After you register an undo operation, the undo manager to revert to the state of the last undo operation. When undoing an action, UndoManager saves the operations you reverted to so that you can call redo() automatically.

What did you learn while working on this project?
Besides gaining technical knowledge in areas like Data Structures, UI using Java Swing and File Handling, the project gave us an opportuanity to work on our team building skills. Working in an environment which is completely virtual can prove to be tedious at times with managing timings and setting up meetings and distributing work, but this project was able to provide us that experience and was a learning opportuanity for our team.

What's next for the project?
We have had ideas of combining speech recognition, speech to text functions, spelling and grammar checks and predictive texts with the current project.
