**SUPERMARKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**OBJECTIVE:**

* We have tried to implement all the main functions that are required to run a supermarket.This includes billing, maintaining stock details, managing information about products,   dealers and employees. 
* Our project simulates the job of each and every member working in the supermarket. Every employee will get a different access to the application according to his/her role in     the supermarket.
* It reduces the time and manpower required for management and maintenance of different tasks as the entire system is fully computerized.

**DATA STRUCTURE:**

We used a Singly Linked List to represent the list of products, dealers, customers and employees that are associated with the Supermarket because:
* They are dynamic in nature.
* Insertion order is maintained.
* This is ideal for our application where we have a large data and unknown number of objects so by using it 
  insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented.

 **WHAT WE HAVE LEARNT:**
 
 * How to manage databases using MySQL.
 * How to implement JDBC.
 * How to implement linked lists using user defined functions.
 
 **WHAT WE CAN ADD FURTHER:**
 
 * We can define function for calculating Profit and Loss.
 * We can give login credentials to the employees.
 * We can make a UI by using JAVA Swing.
